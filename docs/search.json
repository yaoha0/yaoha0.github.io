My journey began during my polytechnic years, and I had the privilege of implementing classroom knowledge into real-world impact during my internship at The FinLab. It was a transformative experience witnessing how technology can enhance efficiency and bring benefits to the industry.\nMy academic journey equipped me with a diverse skill set such as Python, C, C#, SQL, and RPA, enabling me to navigate the dynamic landscape of fintech. My academic foundation, coupled with practical experience, positions me to contribute meaningfully to the intersection of finance and technology.\nDuring my free time, I spend valuable moments with family and friends through games and outdoor activities like playing basketball, hiking and running. These experiences not only create lasting memories but also strengthen bonds with loved ones, ensuring no regrets.\n\n\n\n‘A picture of me recently at Hainan while travelling with my family!’\n\n\nMy LinkedIn Profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/koh-yao-hao/."

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, approximately 1,500 died, making the incident the deadliest sinking of a single ship at the time. Titanic, operated by the White Star Line (Wikipedia), carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere in Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada. The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired a lasting legacy in popular culture. Source: Wikipedia."

The data suggests that they were. The survival rate of 1st-class passengers was 62.04%, while the survival rate of 3rd-class passengers was only 25.53%. Crew members were even less likely to survive than 3rd-class passengers.\nFor passengers, the more luxurious the class, the more likely they were to survive. This is because the 1st-class cabins were located closer to the lifeboats, making it easier for 1st-class passengers to reach them in time.\n\n\n\nAnna Sofia Turja\n\n\nPhoto of Anna Sofia Turja before the Titanic disaster.

The movie was a huge success and won 11 Academy Awards. It tells the story of the Titanic disaster and the love story between Jack and Rose, two passengers on the ship.\nThe movie was praised for its special effects and attention to detail in recreating the ship and the disaster. However, it was also criticized for its historical inaccuracies and portrayal of the events. Despite this, it became the highest-grossing film of all time at its release. The movie was re-released in 3D in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Titanic disaster.\nVideo"

I have been learning the basics of R programming and how to use RStudio. I have also been learning how to use R Markdown to create documents that combine R code and text. I have been enjoying the process of learning R programming and I am excited to learn more as I practice. I used Co-Pilot & ChatGPT in helping me with understanding various syntax meaning and how i can apply the markdown at appropriate places. It is very beneficial for me as a beginner in R programming as it provides all the basic coding syntax and example that i need to know. At the same time, i think it can be challenging as I do not know everything about R and can be hard at times to ask ChatGPT about it. Furthermore, ChatGPT might not be able to understand my question and provide me with the correct answer. I will continue to practice and learn R programming as I am excited to see how it can help me with Data Visualisation in future!"
