RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner that sank on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg on the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, approximately 1,500 died, making the incident the deadliest sinking of a single ship at the time. Titanic, operated by the White Star Line ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Star_Line){target="_blank"}), carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere in Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada. The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired a lasting legacy in popular culture.

## Why is the Titanic Famous?

The Titanic is famous for many reasons, including:

1.  She was the largest ship in the world.
2.  She sank on her maiden voyage.
3.  Her captain received many warnings of ice on the route but did not reduce speed.
4.  There were not enough lifeboats for all the people on board.
5.  Many crew and paying passengers lost their lives, but the man that effectively owned the Titanic somehow survived.
6.  With millionaires as well as people in dire poverty, there was a diverse mix of passengers and crew, leaving behind many fascinating stories of their lives.

## Survival Rate

According to [Encyclopedia Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/), the survival rate of the passengers was as follows:

| Class     | Survived | Total | Survival Rate |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------------|
| 1st Class | 201      | 324   | 62.04%        |
| 2nd Class | 118      | 284   | 41.55%        |
| 3rd Class | 181      | 709   | 25.53%        |
| Crew      | 212      | 891   | 23.79%        |

### Was Survival Dependent on Class?

> â€” Anna Sofia Turja ([3rd-class passenger](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/anna-sofia-turja.html))

This quote raises the question: Were 1st-class passengers more likely to survive than 3rd-class passengers? The data suggests that they were. The survival rate of 1st-class passengers was 62.04%, while the survival rate of 3rd-class passengers was only 25.53%. Crew members were even less likely to survive than 3rd-class passengers.

For passengers, the more luxurious the class, the more likely they were to survive. This is because the 1st-class cabins were located closer to the lifeboats, making it easier for 1st-class passengers to reach them in time.

The *Titanic* movie was released in 1997 and was directed by James Cameron. The movie was a huge success and won 11 Academy Awards. It tells the story of the Titanic disaster and the love story between Jack and Rose, two passengers on the ship.

The movie was praised for its special effects and attention to detail in recreating the ship and the disaster. However, it was also criticized for its historical inaccuracies and portrayal of the events. Despite this, it became the highest-grossing film of all time at its release. The movie was re-released in 3D in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Titanic disaster.
