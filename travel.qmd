Recently I have been to Thailand and China (Hainan). I went to Phuket, Thailand for a short getaway with my friends during school holidays! We had been planning to go on a trip together for a very long time and it is a trip created from a group! After returning from Phuket, it was time for a trip to Hainan, China with my family and relatives! It was a great experience to travel with my family and relatives as we had a lot of fun together!

Here are some pictures of my trip.
